libscheme should work on the following systems with little or no
modification if you have an ANSI C compiler: 

	    Sun 3
	    Sun 4 under SunOS 4.X or Solaris2.X
	    Vax under 4.3BSD, Ultrix
	    Intel 386 or 486 under many operating systems, but not MSDOS.
	    Sequent Symmetry  (single threaded)
	    Encore Multimax   (single threaded)
	    MIPS M/120 (and presumably M/2000) (RISC/os 4.0 with BSD libraries)
	    IBM PC/RT  (Berkeley UNIX)
	    IBM RS/6000
	    HP9000/300
	    HP9000/700
	    DECstations under Ultrix
	    DEC Alpha running OSF/1
	    SGI workstations under IRIX
	    Sony News
	    Apple MacIntosh under A/UX
	    Commodore Amiga (see README.amiga)
	    NeXT machines

To compile libscheme:

	1) Edit the Makefile changing the C compiler, compiler flags,
	and ranlib processor if necessary.

	2) Type `make depend' 

	3) Type `make'

	4) To test the system, type `make test', then run the
	executable ./test and (load "test.scm").  You may also test
	R4RS and inexact number features by typing `(test-sc4)' and
	`(test-inexact)'. In each case you should see a message to the
	effect of `All tests passed'.  Note that the (test-cont) will
	always fail because libscheme does not provide upward
	continuations. 
	
	5) For documentation on the architecture of the system and
	information on extending libscheme, see the doc/ directory.
