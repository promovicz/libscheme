New in release 0.5.

Significantly liberalized copyright so that libscheme can be used in
commercial programs.

Added C++ linkage stuff to header file to facilitate the use of
libscheme from C++ programs.

Made test interpreter and load function ignore the first line of a
file if it begins with `#!' in order to facilitate writing executable
scripts in a Unix environment.

Removed dependence on the `%n' [sf]printf directive so that libscheme
will work with broken SunOS 4.1.[23] C library.
