The doc directory contains a paper about libscheme that has examples
of using libscheme as an interface to a set of library functions.  It
may be somewhat out-of-date compared to the current libscheme.

The posix directory contains a libscheme interface that extends the
libscheme interpreter with bindings to the POSIX file system
interface, and several bindings to the POSIX process interface.

Most of libscheme is implemented with the same interface that
libscheme users use to extend libscheme.
