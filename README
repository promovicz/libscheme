libscheme is a C library implementing Scheme as described in the
Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.  It is easily
integrated into a C program as a command interpreter or extension
langauge, and is easily extended in C with new primitive types,
primitve functions and syntax.

See BUGS for known bugs.
